# Agents and Planning Models Evaluation ðŸ¤–

Toolkit for collecting datasets for Agents and Planning models and running evaluation pipelines.

## SetUp

```shell 
pip install requirements.txt
```

## Project Template Generation
The challenge is to **generate project template** -- small compilable project that can be described in 1-5 sentences 
containing small examples of all mentioned libraries/technologies/functionality.

### Dataset
Project from [GitHub](https://github.com/) written in `Java` and `Kotlin` programming languages 
with 10+ stars and 10+ code lines, permissive licences, without forks (collected by https://seart-ghs.si.usi.ch) 
filtered by `is_template=True` or template-related keywords words presence in description.
From `Java` and `Kotlin` the `Android` projects were identified by `android` token in description or tags and 
moved to separate category.

Collected data is available in [HuggingFace ðŸ¤—](https://huggingface.co/datasets/JetBrains-Research/template-generation), data was manually labeled to select test subset in [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tQLWBBlfDA9l72wpXT7DbqkAt9FWUo0bt9dDX1X9AU8/edit#gid=907232403)

### Agent Models
OpenAI GTP-4 with function calling, prompted with file system api (create/delete/list/... files)
