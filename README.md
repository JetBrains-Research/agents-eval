# Agents and Planning Models Evaluation ðŸ¤–

Toolkit for collecting datasets for Agents and Planning models and running evaluation pipelines.

## Project Template Generation
The challenge is to **generate project template** -- small compilable project that can be described in 1-5 sentences 
containing small examples of all mentioned libraries/technologies/functionality.

### Dataset
`Java` and `Kotlin` programming languages with 10+ stars, permissive licences, not forks (collected by https://seart-ghs.si.usi.ch) 
filtered by `is_template=True` or template-related keywords words presence in description

### Agent Models
OpenAI GTP-4 with function calling, prompted with file system api (create/delete/list/... files)
