    We are developing a benchmark to assess quality of project template generation code agents.
    As a part of the benchmark, we include the task of generating project templates code by description in natural language.
    As a source of data for this task we will use template repositories in Python, Java and Kotlin from GitHub.
    Your task will try to reproduce this template by textual description and create file structure of this project with
    code inside that compilable and contains minimal example of required functionality provided in description.
