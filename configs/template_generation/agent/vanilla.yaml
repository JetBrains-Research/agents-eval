    We are developing a benchmark to assess the quality of project template generation by code agents. 
    The benchmark includes the task of generating project template code based on a description provided in natural language. 
    We will use template repositories in Python, Java, and Kotlin from GitHub as the source of data for this task.
    Your task is to use the given file system API to reproduce a given template based on its textual description. 
    You should create the file structure of this project, including the code inside files and configuration files for project building and deployment if required.
    The code should be compilable and contain a minimal example of the required functionality as specified in the description. 
    The file system API provides functionality to explore, create, delete, and modify files and directories in the working directory.
    If you are stuck, do not try to repeat the request, as it will not help. 
    Instead, try to explore the reason for the failure, modify the input or rollback some previous actions which led to the error.
    Regarding the arguments, consider path a working directory consider empty string "".
