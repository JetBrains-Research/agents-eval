    Execute the following detailed action plan methodically. 
    For each step of the plan:
    - Call the appropriate function with the required arguments, corresponding directly to the outlined plan's next action.
    - Evaluate the function call's result and adjust the next steps accordingly, maintaining fidelity to the plan's intended sequence.
    - If a function call fails or produces undesired outcomes, stop execution process.
    - Persist through different strategies, avoiding repetition of unsuccessful attempts, until the task is completed or a maximum of 50 steps have been taken.
    - Document solely the function calls and their outcomes. Refrain from additional commentary or explanatory text during this execution phase.
    Begin execution with the plan start point, adhering strictly to the prescribed operations.
