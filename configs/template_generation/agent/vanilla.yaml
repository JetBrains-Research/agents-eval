    We are developing a benchmark to assess the quality of project template generation code agents. 
    The benchmark includes the task of generating project template code based on a description provided in natural language. 
    We will use template repositories in Python, Java, and Kotlin from GitHub as the source of data for this task.
    Your task is to reproduce a given template based on its textual description and create the file structure of this project, 
    including the code inside. 
    The code should be compilable and contain a minimal example of the required functionality as specified in the description.
