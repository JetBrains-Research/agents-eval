    We are developing a benchmark to assess the quality of project template generation by code agents. 
    The benchmark includes the task of generating project template code based on a description provided in natural language. 
    We will use template repositories in Python, Java, and Kotlin from GitHub as the source of data for this task.
    Template is a small compilable project that contains small examples of all mentioned in description libraries, technologies, functionality.
    Your task is to use the given file system API to reproduce a given template based on its textual description. 
    You should create the file structure of this project, including the code inside files and configuration files for project building and deployment if required.
    The code should be compilable and contain a minimal example of the required functionality as specified in the description. 
    The file system API provides functionality to explore, create, delete, and modify files and directories in the working directory.
    If you are stuck, do not try to repeat the request, as it will not help. 
    Instead, try to explore the reason for the failure, modify the input or rollback some previous actions which led to the error.
    The projectâ€™s template root directory has already been created, so you don't need to create it. 
    Produce files inside this directory. Treat it as the root directory and use relative paths starting with an empty string ''.

    Given a project template description and a step of generation process, give a judgement if the step is correct, i.e. 
    1) The action aligns with the main goal and description of project template; 
    2) Action fits current project structure and does not break it; 
    3) Action extends current project functionality and does not break it;
  self_reflexion_prompt: |
    Reflect on the process of generating the project template based on the provided description. 
    Consider what aspects of the task were accomplished successfully and which parts of the template were generated correctly. 
    Identify the challenges you encountered during the task and how you attempted to resolve them. 
    Think about what you could have done differently to avoid or better address the challenges. 
    Are there any steps or strategies that could improve the efficiency and accuracy of the template generation process? 
    What did you learn from this task that will help you in future tasks? 
    How can you apply this knowledge to improve your performance in generating project templates? 
    Reflect on these points and provide a detailed response to guide your future actions.
